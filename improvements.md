# Potential Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and future enhancements for the DCE-MRI Analysis Tool. These ideas aim to expand functionality, improve user experience, and increase the tool's versatility.

## Data Input/Output and Management

1.  **DICOM Support:**
    *   Implement robust loading of DCE-MRI series directly from DICOM files. This should include handling of multi-frame DICOMs, mosaics, and proper extraction of metadata (TR, TE, flip angle, slice thickness, pixel spacing, acquisition times).
    *   Support for loading DICOM T1 maps and segmentation objects (DICOM SEG).
2.  **BIDS Compatibility:**
    *   Support for organizing input data and saving outputs according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard, particularly for neuroimaging DCE-MRI.
3.  **Project/Session Management:**
    *   Allow users to save the entire analysis state (loaded files, AIF settings, model parameters, ROI definitions, generated maps) into a project file.
    *   Implement functionality to load these project files to resume previous sessions.
4.  **Enhanced Masking Tools:**
    *   Allow creation and editing of masks directly within the GUI (e.g., brush, thresholding tools).
    *   Support for loading and saving masks in formats other than NIfTI (if common).

## AIF and Concentration Conversion

1.  **Automated AIF Detection:**
    *   Explore algorithms for semi-automated or automated detection of an arterial region for AIF extraction, possibly guided by anatomical landmarks or signal characteristics.
2.  **More Population AIF Models:**
    *   Integrate additional published population AIF models from the literature.
3.  **T1<sub>0</sub> Map Generation (Basic):**
    *   If variable flip angle (VFA) data or multiple TR/TE scans are available, implement a basic T1<sub>0</sub> map calculation module.
4.  **B<sub>1</sub> Correction:**
    *   For T1 mapping and concentration calculations, incorporate options for B<sub>1</sub> field inhomogeneity correction if B<sub>1</sub> maps are provided.

## Pharmacokinetic Modeling

1.  **Additional Pharmacokinetic Models:**
    *   Implement more advanced or specialized models:
        *   **Shutter-Speed Model (SSM):** Accounts for water exchange rates.
        *   **Tracer-Kinetic Models with Water Exchange (e.g., AATH, 2CXM-WX):** More complete models considering water exchange.
        *   **Reference Region Models:** Models that use a reference tissue curve instead of an AIF (e.g., for specific applications where AIF is hard to obtain).
2.  **Model Selection Guidance:**
    *   Incorporate tools or information (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion - AIC, Bayesian Information Criterion - BIC) to help users select the most appropriate model for their data.
3.  **Pixel-wise Goodness-of-Fit:**
    *   Generate and display maps of goodness-of-fit metrics (e.g., R<sup>2</sup>, Chi-squared) for the model fitting on a per-voxel basis.
4.  **Global/Constrained Fitting:**
    *   Explore options for spatially constrained or global model fitting to improve parameter robustness, especially in noisy data.

## Visualization and ROI Analysis

1.  **Advanced ROI Tools:**
    *   Support for non-rectangular ROIs (e.g., polygonal, freehand).
    *   Ability to propagate ROIs across slices or through time (for 4D ROIs on dynamic series).
    *   Saving/loading ROIs in standard formats (e.g., RTSTRUCT-like, or simple JSON/XML).
2.  **Improved Plotting:**
    *   More interactive plot customization options (colors, line styles, labels).
    *   Ability to plot multiple voxel curves or ROI-averaged curves simultaneously.
    *   Export plots in vector formats (SVG, PDF) with publication quality.
3.  **3D Visualization:**
    *   Basic 3D rendering of parameter maps or segmentations (e.g., using libraries like `vedo` or `vtk`).
4.  **Integration of Image Registration:**
    *   Provide tools or interfaces for motion correction of the DCE series.
    *   Allow registration of T1 maps or masks to the DCE series if they are not perfectly aligned.

## User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

1.  **GUI Theming and Modernization:**
    *   Update GUI elements for a more modern look and feel. Allow user-selectable themes (light/dark).
2.  **Undo/Redo Functionality:**
    *   Implement undo/redo capabilities for operations like ROI placement, parameter changes.
3.  **More Comprehensive Error Reporting:**
    *   Provide more informative error messages and suggestions for users when issues occur.
4.  **Plugin Architecture:**
    *   Design a plugin system to allow users or developers to add new models, AIFs, or analysis tools more easily.

## Batch Processing and Reporting

1.  **Expanded Batch Capabilities:**
    *   Allow `batch_processor.py` to process multiple datasets specified in a manifest file (e.g., a CSV listing input files and parameters for each subject).
    *   Enable generation of summary reports (e.g., aggregated ROI statistics across a cohort) from batch processing.
2.  **Scripting Interface / API:**
    *   Expose core functionalities (data loading, AIF processing, model fitting) as a Python API for easier scripting and integration into other workflows.

## Packaging and Distribution

1.  **PyPI Package:**
    *   Package the tool for distribution via PyPI (`pip install dce-mri-analyzer`).
2.  **Standalone Executables:**
    *   Create standalone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to simplify usage for non-Python users.
3.  **Documentation:**
    *   Host the Wiki documentation online (e.g., using GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs).

These are just some ideas, and prioritization would depend on user needs and development resources. Contributions in any of these areas would be welcome.
