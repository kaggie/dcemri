"""Data validation utilities for the DCE-MRI analysis application.

This module is intended to contain functions for validating various types of
input data, parameters, and configurations used within the application.
For example, it might include functions to:
- Validate the format and content of input files (e.g., NIfTI, CSV).
- Check the range and type of numerical parameters.
- Ensure consistency between different data structures.

Currently, this module is empty. Validation logic might be implemented
directly within data loading functions or UI input handlers for now.
This serves as a placeholder for more centralized validation utilities
if the application grows in complexity.
