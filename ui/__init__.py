"""User Interface (UI) package for the DCE-MRI analysis application.

This package contains modules related to the graphical user interface (GUI)
of the application, built using a library like PyQt or Tkinter (though specific
library details would be in submodules). It typically includes:
- Main application window setup and layout.
- Custom widgets used throughout the UI.
- Dialogs for user interaction (e.g., file selection, settings).
- UI-specific logic and event handling.
