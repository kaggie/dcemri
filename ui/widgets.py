"""Custom UI widgets for the DCE-MRI analysis application.

This module is intended to contain custom PyQt5 widgets that are used to build
the user interface of the application. These might include specialized input fields,
display widgets, or compound controls that are not standard in PyQt5.

Currently, this module is empty as all UI elements are defined within
`main_window.py` or are standard PyQt5/pyqtgraph widgets. It serves as a
placeholder for future custom widget development if needed.
